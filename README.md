# Incented-Protocol---Web2-App

Application Architecture Design - Incented Protocol

Purpose

Incented Protocol is a web application to empower communities and (DAOs) by providing a user-friendly and transparent platform coordinating and incentivizing the completion of tasks.  Community members have the ability to contribute to a task while being rewarded for their efforts.  

The user-base consists of community users, community administrators, and super administrators.  Users will be able to propose, prioritize, contribute, review a proposed task while community administrators will manage their community and associated funds used for incentivizing tasks.  On the other hand, super administrators will manage all communities, members, and distribution of funds to each community.  

-The purpose of the Incented Protocol Web2 App is to empower communities and (DAOs) by providing a user-friendly and transparent platform for task coordination, incentivization, and efficient management, enabling community members(Rabbits) to ‚Äúcontribute ‚Äù while being rewarded (Carrots) fairly for their efforts.
